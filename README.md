How CopyCalc is Different
Unlike other clipboard calculators (such as Aiac or Clipboard Calculator), CopyCalc requires no extra hotkeys or manual input fields. Simply set an operator once, then keep copying numbers from anywhere — the calculation happens instantly in the background. It also supports repeated same-value copies (e.g., 7 + 7) without missing an entry, something many similar tools can’t handle.
