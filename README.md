# CopyCalc

A lightweight Windows clipboard calculator — copy numbers to instantly add, subtract, multiply, or divide without ever typing them in.

---

## 🚀 Overview
**CopyCalc** changes the way you calculate. Instead of typing numbers into a calculator, simply:
1. Open CopyCalc and set your desired operator (**+**, **–**, **×**, **÷**).
2. Copy numbers from *any* app — spreadsheets, web pages, emails, PDFs.
3. Each copied number is automatically applied to your running total.
4. See every step in the real-time history panel.

## ✨ Features
- **Clipboard-based calculation** — No typing needed. Just copy a number, and CopyCalc does the math.
- **Active operator latch** — Set your operator once, then keep copying numbers until you change it.
- **Same-number copy detection** — Works with repeated values (e.g., `7 + 7`), no missed entries.
- **Real-time history log** — Track every operation and updated total instantly.
- **One-click reset** — Clear your total and history in one tap.
- **Lightweight & portable** — Runs on Windows 10/11 without installation bloat.

## 🔍 How CopyCalc is Different
Unlike other clipboard calculators (such as *Aiac* or *Clipboard Calculator*), **CopyCalc** requires **no extra hotkeys** or manual input fields. Simply set an operator once, copy numbers from anywhere, and watch your total update in real-time. It also supports **repeated same-value copies** without skipping.
